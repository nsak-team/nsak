\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:sequence-diagram.drawio}} shows the interaction sequence for building,
loading, and executing a scenario within NSAK.
The diagram focuses on the main modularity concept and describes the orchestration flow between scenarios
and drills without interface details, error-handling, and drill or scenario clean-up mechanisms.

The process begins with the operator triggering the build command for a scenario container.
During this phase, the selected scenario is loaded and returned as a containerized representation.
In the execution phase, the Scenario Manager runs the container image and orchestrates the Drills order.
The Drill Manager executes the required drills.

A scenario may contain multiple drills; therefore, the * signalize various drills can be executed from a Drill Manager
in a one scenario.
Each drill is resolved and executed individually, while the Scenario Manager maintains complete control
over the scenario lifecycle.
