\section{Current State of Research}\label{sec:current-state-of-research}


Recent studies highlight the importance of modularity, reproducibility, and automation to reduce the operational overhead of
security assessments.
Methodologies such as red and blue teaming, and their combinations within the InfoSec color wheel, show
the complexity and overlapping disciplines in the security sector.
\cite{NIST2012RedTeamBlueTeamApproach, cremen2018infoseccolourwheel}

On a technical level, threat emulation frameworks such as CALDERA, Atomic Red Team, and Metasploit
implement multi-stage attack scenarios to evaluate the detection of defensive systems.
However, many existing frameworks focus primarily on large-scale enterprise environments and require significant
setup effort, limiting their adaptability in resource-constrained networks.

These aspects highlight the need for a lightweight and modular framework to reduce overall cyber thread risks in
network infrastructures.\cite{WEF2025GlobalRisks}
