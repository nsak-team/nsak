\section{Future work}\label{sec:future-work}

While the present proof of concept demonstrates the modularity and scenario-based network security framework, several
aspects require extension and investigation.


A key area for future work is the introduction of a RESTful API that provides parity with the existing command-line
interface.
Building on this API, a graphical user interface that leverages the CLI logic improves accessibility for a wider
range of users and could also help in educational settings and labs.

The evaluation revealed limitations in the current cleanup procedure.
Temporary configuration artifacts and network rules were not removed, which affects the successive usage of multiple scenarios.
Furthermore, the device would be more likely to be detected.


Increasing test coverage is essential to validate the correctness and stability of the framework as it evolves.
Automated testing would improve reliability and support long-term maintainability.

Finally, integrating automated analysis of defensive responses would enable more comprehensive blue- and purple-team assessments.
