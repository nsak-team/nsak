We describe NSAK-devive as an embedded, modular, open source, scenario-based network sniffing and security framework.
We provide an overview of the system design, emphasizing the functionality of a Swiss Army Knife in a networking context.
The attack scenario includes drills that configure or target a specific task to observe or open an attack vector in the system.
NSAK-device is based on a core back-end part that manages specific environments, scenarios, and drills.
The whole concept is based on containerization, where each container builds or prepares a scenario that can be triggered in a network environment.
In the analogy of the Swiss Army Knife, the right knife with the proper drills for the necessary task can be selected.
Modularity comes into play when a drill is selected across multiple scenarios.
The system was evaluated two different embedded ARM-based devices which a modular drill execution across different scenarios.

These results indicate that NSAK-device is well suited for security experimentation and controlled attack simulations in
constrained environments.
The framework provides a practical foundation for network security analysis and can be extended to support automated
testing and future attack scenarios.
