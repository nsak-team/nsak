\subsection{System Dependencies}\label{subsec:system-dependencies}

\todo{Write this section nicer and explain what the advantages are of such a design is, especially in relation to modularity}

As we leverage the abstraction of OCI containers to run scenarios in an encapsulated environment, we have only a minimal set of system dependencies.
All system dependencies that are required for running a drill or a scenario are installed into the scenario image, during the build process.


Version control: git
Network tooling: iptables (we should switch to nf\_tables)
OCI container manager: podman
OCI container orchestrator: podman-compose
Programming languages: python3, python3-pip, uv
Utilities: curl, sudo
