# Zero Trust Architecture: A Systematic Literature Review

Source: [Zero Trust Architecture: A Systematic Literature Review](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.11659v2)

## Abstract

Traditional Perimeter-Based Security Model (PBSM) provides limited protection against cyberattacks.
Leading to the growing adoption of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), which builds on the principle of ”never trust, always verify”:
- continuous authentication
- conditional access
- dynamic trust evaluation
- the principle of least privilege

The study uses the PRISMA framework to analyze 10 years of research (2016–2025) on ZTA,
presenting a systematic literature review (SLR):
- applications
- enabling technologies
- associated challenges

Citation:
"This comprehensive analysis serves as a practical guide for researchers
and practitioners seeking to leverage ZTA for stronger,
more adaptive security frameworks in a rapidly shifting threat landscape."

## 1 Introduction
The adoption of cloud computing, IoT and other trends increases network complexity abd extends traditional network boundaries
and thus limiting the effectiveness of PBSM:
- Multiple internal networks
- Connecting to external entities: Remote offices, partner networks
- Wider range of devices: bring your own device (BYOD) and work from home (WFH)

Citation:
"ZTA acts under the assumption of a hostile environment"

- more than 50% of companies worldwide have either partially or fully implemented zero trust strategy
- global market value of zero trust is expected to reach 133 billion US dollars by 2032 compared to 31.63 in 2023

These figures demonstrate the growing demand for ZTA in a constantly shifting threat environment.

The key contributions of this SLR are summarized as follows:
- systematic taxonomy categorizing ZTA applications, implementation requirements, enabling technologies, and associated challenges
- concrete examples and case studies from the reviewed literature
- We present a critical analysis of the enabling technologies that facilitate ZTA adoption which can aid in understanding the technological landscape that supports ZTA frameworks.
- This paper identifies and elaborates on the challenges of ZTA adoption which are pivotal for overcoming practical barriers to ZTA implementation.

# Thoughts:
This paper is a great overview of the current state of ZTA.
I searched the article for the terms "test" and "autom", to see if the topic "test automation" or "security automation" is covered in the paper and thus in the current Literatur - with interesting results:
- test: 5 matches
- autom: 15 matches

This means that the topic is not covered in the paper.
